# Intranet

Lightweight local HTTP file server with dynamic Python pages — no Apache/nginx needed, no root required. Designed for exposing workspace files to your local LAN: dashboards, JSON APIs, and web UIs for local automations.

**Entry point:** `{baseDir}/scripts/intranet.py`

## Setup

See [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) for prerequisites and setup instructions.

## Commands

```bash
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/intranet.py start                          # Start on default port 8080
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/intranet.py start --port 9000              # Custom port
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/intranet.py start --dir /path/to/webroot   # Custom root directory
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/intranet.py start --host localhost          # Local-only (no LAN)
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/intranet.py status                         # Check if running
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/intranet.py stop                           # Stop server
```

## Features

### Dynamic Python Pages

Executable `.py` files in the webroot run as CGI scripts — dashboards, JSON APIs, data views. The file must have the executable bit set (`chmod +x`).

### Plugin Support via Symlinks

Other skills add content by symlinking directories into the webroot:

```bash
ln -s {workspace}/deliveries {workspace}/intranet/deliveries
ln -s {workspace}/banker {workspace}/intranet/banker
```

Served at `http://localhost:8080/deliveries/`, `http://localhost:8080/banker/`, etc.

### Remote Access via ngrok

To access from outside your LAN (e.g. checking dashboards on your phone):

```bash
ngrok http 8080 --url your-domain.ngrok-free.app
```

⚠️ This exposes CGI execution to the internet. Only use with a fixed domain and understand the risk.

## Security

- **Path containment** — all paths are resolved and checked; requests cannot traverse outside the webroot
- **Symlink targets must be within the workspace or /tmp** — symlinks pointing elsewhere are rejected
- **CGI execution requires executable permission** (`chmod +x`) AND the script must resolve to a path within the workspace
- **Default bind: `0.0.0.0`** (all interfaces, accessible from LAN). Use `--host localhost` to restrict to local machine only. True LAN-only restriction requires firewall rules on your OS.
- Treat all symlinked content and `.py` files in the webroot as trusted — the server will execute them

## Notes
- PID file: `~/.intranet.pid`
- Config file: `~/.intranet.conf`
- Default root: `{workspace}/intranet/` (override with `--dir` or `INTRANET_DIR`)
- 30-second timeout on CGI execution
