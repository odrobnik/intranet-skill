# Intranet

Lightweight local HTTP file server with dynamic Python pages. Other skills plug in content via symlinks.

**Entry point:** `{baseDir}/scripts/intranet.py`

## Setup

See [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) for prerequisites and setup instructions.

## Commands

```bash
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/intranet.py start                          # Start on default port 8080
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/intranet.py start --port 9000              # Custom port
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/intranet.py start --dir /path/to/webroot   # Custom root directory
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/intranet.py start --host localhost          # Bind to localhost only
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/intranet.py status                         # Check if running
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/intranet.py stop                           # Stop server
```

## Features

### Dynamic Python Pages

Executable `.py` files in the webroot are run as CGI scripts, enabling dynamic content like dashboards, APIs, or data views. Just make a `.py` file executable and it serves as a dynamic page.

### Plugin Support via Symlinks

Other skills add content by symlinking directories into the webroot:

```bash
ln -s {workspace}/deliveries {workspace}/intranet/deliveries
ln -s {workspace}/banker {workspace}/intranet/banker
```

Served at `http://localhost:8080/deliveries/`, `http://localhost:8080/banker/`, etc.

### Remote Access via ngrok

To access the intranet from outside your LAN, tunnel it with [ngrok](https://ngrok.com):

```bash
ngrok http 8080
```

If you have a fixed ngrok domain: `ngrok http 8080 --url your-domain.ngrok-free.app`

## Security

- **Path traversal protection** — all paths are resolved and checked against the webroot; requests cannot escape the root directory
- **Symlinks within the webroot** are followed (for plugin support), but path components outside the root are rejected
- Binds to `0.0.0.0` by default — use `--host localhost` to restrict to local access only

## Notes
- PID file: `~/.intranet.pid`
- Config file: `~/.intranet.conf`
- Default root: `{workspace}/intranet/` (override with `--dir` or `INTRANET_DIR` env var)
